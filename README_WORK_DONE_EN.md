# Work Done (16.10.2025 - 24.10.2025)

This document outlines the work completed on the Safe Query Agent project between October 16th and October 24th, 2025, and details the next steps for future development.

## Completed Work

- **Project Setup**: Initialized a new React + TypeScript project using Vite.
- **Dependency Management**: Installed and configured all necessary dependencies, including React, Redux Toolkit, and Material-UI.
- **Folder Structure**: Created a comprehensive folder structure to organize components, services, data, and styles.
- **Component Implementation**: Developed all the core UI components, including:
  - `ChatWindow`: For user interaction and displaying conversation history.
  - `SQLPreview`: To display the generated SQL, with syntax highlighting and a copy-to-clipboard feature.
  - `ValidationPanel`: To handle missing parameters and display follow-up questions.
  - `SchemaBrowser`: To visualize the database schema.
  - `LogsViewer`: To display application logs.
  - `TestRunner`: To run test cases and compare the generated SQL with golden versions.
- **Service Implementation**: Implemented the core services for the application:
  - `mockEngine`: To generate mock SQL and handle validation.
  - `schemaService`: To load the database schema.
  - `logsService`: To persist and retrieve logs from `localStorage`.
  - `testsService`: To load test cases.
- **State Management**: Set up the Redux store and created slices for session and UI state.
- **Security**: Implemented a basic SQL sanitizer to detect and flag forbidden keywords.
- **Troubleshooting**: Resolved several technical challenges, including:
  - Compatibility issues between React 19 and Material-UI, which were resolved by downgrading to React 18.
  - Rendering issues with the Material-UI `Grid` and `TreeView` components.
- **UI/UX Refinement**: Implemented a more organized, full-page layout with a collapsible sidebar and tabbed main area, and a new color scheme.
- **Internationalization**: Translated the user interface to Russian.
- **Translation and Recognition**: Added a feature to translate Russian sentences to English and recognize the intent.

## Future Steps

- **UI/UX Refinement**: Improve the overall look and feel of the application.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance the error handling to provide more informative feedback to the user.
- **Mock Engine Expansion**: Expand the capabilities of the mock SQL generator to support a wider range of queries.
- **RAG/Lookup Enhancement**: Implement a more robust RAG/lookup mechanism.
- **Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive test cases to ensure the stability of the application.
- **DOM Nesting**: Address the `validateDOMNesting` warning in the browser console.
- **React 19 Upgrade**: Investigate and potentially upgrade to React 19 once all compatibility issues with Material-UI are resolved.
- **Backend Stub**: Implement a lightweight backend stub for shared demos.
