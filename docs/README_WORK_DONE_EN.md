# Work Done (16.10.2025 - 24.10.2025)

This document outlines the work completed on the Safe Query Agent project between October 16th and October 24th, 2025, and details the next steps for future development.

## Completed Work

- **Project Setup**: Initialized a new React + TypeScript project using Vite.
- **Dependency Management**: Installed and configured all necessary dependencies, including React, Redux Toolkit, and Material-UI.
- **Folder Structure**: Created a comprehensive folder structure to organize components, services, data, and styles.
- **Component Implementation**: Developed all the core UI components, including:
  - `ChatWindow`: For user interaction and displaying conversation history.
  - `SQLPreview`: To display the generated SQL, with syntax highlighting and a copy-to-clipboard feature.
  - `ValidationPanel`: To handle missing parameters and display follow-up questions.
  - `SchemaBrowser`: To visualize the database schema.
  - `LogsViewer`: To display application logs.
  - `TestRunner`: To run test cases and compare the generated SQL with golden versions.
- **Service Implementation**: Implemented the core services for the application:
  - `mockEngine`: To generate mock SQL and handle validation.
  - `schemaService`: To load the database schema.
  - `logsService`: To persist and retrieve logs from `localStorage`.
  - `testsService`: To load test cases.
- **State Management**: Set up the Redux store and created slices for session and UI state.
- **Security**: Implemented a basic SQL sanitizer to detect and flag forbidden keywords.
- **Troubleshooting**: Resolved several technical challenges, including:
  - Compatibility issues between React 19 and Material-UI, which were resolved by downgrading to React 18.
  - Rendering issues with the Material-UI `Grid` and `TreeView` components.
- **UI/UX Refinement**: Implemented a more organized, full-page layout with a collapsible sidebar and tabbed main area, and a new color scheme.
- **Internationalization**: Translated the user interface to Russian.
- **Translation and Recognition**: Added a feature to translate Russian sentences to English and recognize the intent.

## Future Development Plan

### Priority Backlog
- **Complete end-to-end mock interaction flow**: Finalize agentic follow-up UX so missing-parameter prompts, quick-options and user answers update candidate SQL and logs without page reload.
- **Robust parameter validation**: Expand validation rules for dates, time zones, units, identifiers, email normalization and enum resolution from lookups.
- **Expand mock dataset and test-cases**: Add full schema.json coverage, 50+ realistic lookup rows, and extend test-cases to cover edge cases (multi-lingual inputs, ambiguous intents, blacklist triggers).
- **Sanitizer hardening and blacklist enforcement**: Strengthen sqlSanitizer to detect forbidden tokens, suspicious concatenations, and blacklisted table/column references; enforce sanitized SQL view and block unsafe copy actions.

### Technical Improvements
- **State and concurrency**: Ensure optimistic UI updates and handle concurrent clarification flows; avoid race conditions when multiple follow-ups are pending.
- **Schema browsing and lineage hints**: Show column types, nullable flags, sample values, and suggested JOIN paths derived from catalog metadata.
- **Accessibility and UX polish**: Keyboard navigation for chat, panels and quick-options; visible focus states and ARIA labels for major interactive elements.
- **I18n and NL normalization**: Improve translation pipeline for RUâ†’EN intent normalization and add locale-aware date parsing and time-zone suggestions.
