# UI/UX and Functionality Improvement Suggestions for "Безопасный Агент Запросов"

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current UI/UX and functionality of the Safe Query Agent and offers suggestions for improvement.

## 1. Usability, Layout, and Clarity

### Current State
The current layout is functional but could be more intuitive. The two-column layout is a good start, but the relationship between the panels is not always clear, and the interface feels static.

### Suggestions
- **Dynamic Panels**: The `Validation & Follow-up` panel should only be visible when there are questions for the user. This would reduce clutter.
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: The `Schema Browser` and `Sources` could be moved to a collapsible sidebar on the left, allowing the user to hide them when not needed and providing more space for the main content.
- **Tabbed Main Area**: The main area on the right could use tabs to switch between the `SQL Preview`, `Logs Viewer`, and `Test Runner`. This would make better use of the available space.
- **Focus on Chat**: The chat window should be the central focus of the application. Consider making it larger and more prominent.

## 2. SQL Output Accuracy and Input Ambiguity

### Current State
The `mockEngine` is very basic and only recognizes a few keywords. It cannot handle complex queries, and there is no mechanism for resolving ambiguity.

### Suggestions
- **Advanced NLP**: Implement a more sophisticated NLP model to better understand user intent, including joins, filters, and aggregations.
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: When the user's input is ambiguous (e.g., "show me top orders"), the system should ask for clarification in the `Validation & Follow-up` panel (e.g., "Top by what? (e.g., amount, date)").

## 3. Validation and Clarification Panel

### Current State
The panel is currently used only for displaying a single question with a few options.

### Suggestions
- **Dynamic and Interactive**: This panel should be more dynamic. It could be used to:
  - Confirm entities (e.g., "Did you mean the 'orders' table?").
  - Suggest filters and aggregations.
  - Present multiple candidate SQL queries for the user to choose from.
- **Rich UI Elements**: Instead of just chips, use dropdowns, date pickers, and other rich UI elements to make the interaction more intuitive.

## 4. Visual and UX Enhancements

### Current State
The dark theme is a good start, but the overall visual design could be more polished.

### Suggestions
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Implement syntax highlighting for the SQL code in the `SQL Preview` panel. Libraries like `react-syntax-highlighter` can be used for this.
- **Loading Indicators**: Display loading spinners or skeletons when the application is waiting for a response from the mock engine.
- **Tooltips**: Add tooltips to buttons and icons to provide more context.
- **Improved Empty States**: The panels should have more informative "empty state" messages (e.g., "Type a query to get started" in the chat window).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## 5. Multilingual Support

### Current State
The translations are currently hardcoded, which is not a scalable solution.

### Suggestions
- **i18n Library**: Use a proper internationalization library like `i18next` with `react-i18next`.
- **Translation Files**: Store translations in separate JSON files for each language (e.g., `en.json`, `ru.json`).
- **Language Switcher**: Add a language switcher to the UI to allow users to select their preferred language.
- **NLP Translation**: The `translateAndRecognize` function should be replaced with a proper translation service or a multilingual NLP model.

## 6. Error Handling

### Current State
Error handling is minimal, and the application has been prone to crashing during development.

### Suggestions
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement React Error Boundaries to catch and handle rendering errors in components, preventing the entire application from crashing.
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Display clear, user-friendly error messages when something goes wrong.
- **Input Validation**: Add more robust validation for user input to prevent unexpected behavior.
